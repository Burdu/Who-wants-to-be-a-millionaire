- `HistoryEntry`: Tracks player name, score, questions answered, and timestamp
- `Difficulty`: Enum for difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)

### Key Functions
- `loadQuestions()`: Reads questions from file with error handling
- `saveHistory()`: Appends game results with timestamps
- `validateName()`: Ensures valid player name input
- `validateAnswer()`: Checks answer format
- `getTimestamp()`: Generates current timestamp
- `compareScores()`: Custom comparator for leaderboard sorting

##  Files

quiz.exe
```

## How to Play

1. **Launch**: Run the compiled program
2. **Select**: Choose "1. Play Game" from the main menu
3. **Enter Name**: Type your name (letters and spaces only)
4. **Answer Questions**: 
   - Type **A, B, C, or D** for your answer
   - Type **H** for 50/50 help (reveals correct answer, worth 0.5 points)
5. **Stay Correct**: Answer correctly to continue
6. **Survive**: Get a wrong answer = Game Over!

## Menu Options

1. **Play Game** - Start a new quiz session
2. **Game History** - View all past scores with timestamps

## History Format

Each entry in `history.txt` contains:
```
PlayerName Score QuestionsAnswered Timestamp
```

Example:
```
Alice 15.5 18 2024-01-15_14-30
Bob 20.0 20 2024-01-15_15-45
```

Note: Timestamps are displayed nicely in the UI (spaces and colons), but stored with underscores and hyphens for parsing compatibility.

## Adding More Questions

Edit `questions.txt` with the following format:
```
Question text here
